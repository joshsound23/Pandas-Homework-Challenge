# Pandas-Homework-Challenge
In this challenge I created calculations and dataframes to show analysis for a list of schools.
Some of the analysis shown included average math and reading scores for different schools,
total students, total students broken down by each school and so much more. In this challenge, 
I struggled a bit in fully understanding and completing some of the challenge and completed the parts 
I fully knew. I want to be able to seek all resources in future weeks to be able to complete all of future challenges.
